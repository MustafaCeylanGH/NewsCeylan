## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate my skills and capabilities in web development. It fetches and displays news articles from various sources using an external API. Users can search for specific topics or browse news by category.

## Why No Live Link?

Due to API restrictions, the project could not be hosted on platforms like Netlify or Vercel. These platforms returned an HTTP 426 error, indicating that the API does not permit requests from these hosting services. To ensure you can see the project in action, I have provided a demo video above.

## Features

- Fetch news articles based on search queries or categories
- Display headlines, article summaries, and images
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MustafaCeylanGH/NewsCeylan.git

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory
   cd NewsCeylan

3. Install dependencies
   npm install

4. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API key
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

5. Start the development server
   npm start

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
